Product Title:

On-Chain Chess Tournament Platform
Objective

Build a blockchain-based chess competition platform where organizations create and manage tournaments with a stablecoin prize pool. Users can register for multiple tournaments, participate in group-based competition, and winnings are distributed transparently on-chain.
Key Features
1. Tournament Creation (For Organizations)

    Tournament Setup: Organizations can create chess tournaments, specifying:

        Tournament name & description

        Start and end dates

        Prize pool (must be funded with a stablecoin, e.g., USDC/USDT)

        Total number of players (must be divisible by four)

    Prize Distribution:

        Winner: 50% of prize pool

        2nd Place: 30% of prize pool

        3rd Place: 20% of prize pool

    User Cap: Must specify the exact number of participants (divisible by four for group allocation).

2. User Registration and Participation

    Registration Workflow:

        Users can browse available tournaments.

        Users can register for any number of tournaments, but only once per tournament.

        Registration closes when the participant cap is reached or at tournament start.

    Verification:

        Blockchain wallet sign-in to confirm user uniqueness.

        Enforce: No duplicate entry for a user in the same tournament.

3. Group Stage Mechanics

    Grouping Logic:

        Players are randomly allocated into groups of 4.

        Each group plays a round-robin: Each member plays the other 3 members.

    Scoring System:

        Win = 3 points

        Draw = 1 point per player

        Loss = 0 points

    Advancement:

        Top 2 players (by points, then tiebreaker via win count or head-to-head result) from each group advance to the next knockout or mixed group stage.

        Subsequent rounds: Re-grouping based on points/seed.

4. Tournament Progression

    Automated Rounds:

        After group stage, advance top players into new groups or brackets as configured.

        Continue until final placements (1st, 2nd, 3rd) are determined.

    Match Recording:

        Chess matches played on-chain or results validated on-chain.

        All scores and brackets are public and immutable.

5. Prize Distribution

    Stablecoin Payouts:

        Prizes distributed on-chain, automatically at tournament end.

        1st: 50%, 2nd: 30%, 3rd: 20% (direct to winnersâ€™ wallets).

6. Frontend & User Experience

    User Dashboard:

        See active/joined tournaments, standings, and match history.

        Register for upcoming tournaments.

    Tournament Pages:

        List of registered players, group assignments, match results, and prize pool status.

    Game Interface:

        Play matches directly or connect to approved chess engine.

        Results uploaded or verified on-chain.

    Notifications:

        Alerts for match schedules, round advancement, and prize claims.

Additional Technical Requirements

    Smart Contract Logic:

        Tournament management (creation, registration, group allocation, match result submission, prize payout)

    Stablecoin Integration:

        Accept stablecoin for prize pools; handle payouts in same currency.

    Security:

        Audit smart contracts for safety of funds and fairness of logic.

    Transparency:

        All tournament data available on-chain or via explorer.

Constraints & Acceptance Criteria

    Player Entry: No user can join the same tournament more than once.

    Group Size: All tournaments must have participant numbers divisible by 4.

    Prize Pool: Only stablecoin-backed tournaments, with automated proportionate payout.

    Scalable Frontend: Must easily support browsing and joining multiple tournaments.

User Stories

    As an organization, I can create a chess tournament with a stablecoin prize pool and specify participant details.

    As a user, I can browse and join multiple chess tournaments, but never enter a single tournament more than once.

    After playing the group stage, I can see my standings and, if I advance, join the next round.

    If I win or place in the top 3, I receive the correct share of the prize pool automatically in my wallet.
